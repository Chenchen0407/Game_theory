Soccer Penalty Game
The game involves two participants, a server and a client, representing two players in a penalty shootout: the striker (player) and the goalkeeper (goalie). The game is designed to run on two separate computers, utilizing socket programming in Python to facilitate communication between the two machines.

Each player can choose one of two actions: "left" or "right". The server and client code enables each player to input their action choice. The game's outcome depends on both the goalie's and the player's choices, following the principles of the mixed strategy Nash Equilibrium.

Have fun with the codes!
